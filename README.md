# Budgie

This code is based off the work that [Christian Alexander](https://github.com/christianalexander) did for
his Phoenix tutorials. Follow the development progress in the YouTube tutorial series called
[Phoenix App from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL31bV6MaFAPllC8JP0vaRKrVm5kj7c1vc).

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
